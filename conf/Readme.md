# Where to find settings for mcpconfig and mappings

Before you run `gradlew setup` you need to configure the mcp versions for your target Minecraft version in `/conf/settings.json`

Below are links on where to find the mcp versions/builds to enter into the `settings.json` file.
## mcpconfig
The mcp_config builds and mappings can be found at [https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/de/oceanlabs/mcp/mcp_config].

Select your target Minecraft version on the left and find the mcp_config version in the download list.

## mappings
The mcpbot for mcp versions/snapshots can be found at [http://export.mcpbot.bspk.rs/].
